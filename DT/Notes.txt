The code here contains the kernel needed to build decision trees
efficiently.  The reason we call it a "kernel" is that there is plenty
that needs to be bolted on before it can actually produce a decision
tree. For example, we have used the "gini" metric to determine the
quality of a split. Several other metrics could be used instead.

Similarly, we generate random data to test the kernel. Clearly, a proper
mechanism to read in data is required, whether from a CSV file or some other
format. 

Our focus has beeen on the core computations necessary. In this
respect, we have focused on performance and correctness. I believe the
core code is solid and can be adapted with relative ease to make a
fully-fledged decision tree package.

There are 2 key innovations in this implementation

1) It performs a single sort and does not re-sort the data as we
descend down the tree.

2) It uses ISPC to generate code that efficiently uses vector
instructions.

====================== The ISPC portion ==============

There are 3 parts of the code that use ISPC. Hence, they have 2
implementatons, one in C and one in iSPC. These are

reorder.c and reorder_isp.c
eval_metrics.c and eval_metrics_isp.c
calc_best_metric.c and calc_best_metric_isp.c

In order to verify their correctness, there are unit tests written for
each.The unit tests compares the output of the C implementation to
that of ISPC. If they match, we conclude that the ISPC code is
correct. Currently, all tests pass.

Verfication that the C code is correct is handled in check.c and
check_tree.c.  We have written a large number of invariants (but by no
means complete) which examine the data to see if the code is doing the
right thing.

To build the unit tests, edit Makefile so that DFLAGS is set to
DFLAGS = -g -DDEBUG -DSEQUENTIAL  
Then, 
make clean
make ut_calc_best_metric 
make ut_eval_metrics 
make ut_reorder

============ Building the code ===================
Start with make clean
To build  the C version of the code, set following in Makefile
DFLAGS = -O4 -fopenmp -DSCALAR 
make dt
To build  the ISPC version of the code, set following in Makefile
DFLAGS = -O3 -fopenmp -DVECTOR
make ispdt

============ Running the code ===================

Ideally, we would use a config file to set the configuration for the
run.  We have bypassed this step for now, hard-coding it in
read_config.c Some sample values for basic testing and for performance
runs are there.  Feel free to modify as you desire but remember to
re-build.
