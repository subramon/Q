where do we keep max_num_in_chunk? Lua or C. Be consistent
What of init_globals() needs to be saved in Q.save() 
  and restored after that

Make sure that cVector:check() is done more often and uses 
  is_at_rest = true whenever possible
Make sure that if you restore but do not save, files get deleted

Use qcfg.ISPC 
Move q_core   to qcore
