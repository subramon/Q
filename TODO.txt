Bring ISPC back to life
Bring OpenMP back to life
Do some code reviews of save() and import() 
In import, document that order of import is important. Understand why 

Bring webserver back to life
Bring out-of-band server back to life
Experiment with alternating control of qjit with webserver
Experiment with prefetch
Make sure that g_dsk_used is intialized on restore session
g_dsk_used is not changed by import session


where do we keep max_num_in_chunk? Lua or C. Be consistent
What of init_globals() needs to be saved in Q.save() 
  and restored after that
  g_dsk_used should be checked/restored
What happens if you restore but do not save. Do files get deleted?
Or does the persist persist (hah!)
