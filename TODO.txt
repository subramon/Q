Bring ISPC back to life
Bring OpenMP back to life
Do some code reviews of save() and import() 
In import, document that order of import is important. Understand why 

Experiment with alternating control of qjit with webserver
Experiment with prefetch

Write some tests on memory usage with different memo len
Write some tests on memory usage with kill


where do we keep max_num_in_chunk? Lua or C. Be consistent
What of init_globals() needs to be saved in Q.save() 
  and restored after that
What happens if you restore but do not save. Do files get deleted?
Or does the persist persist (hah!)
