Why do we have CLONE as an operator if it is in lVector
Also, lVector allows us to clone only if is_lma() == true

Consider conjoining reducers

Merge AINB and GET and delete things that aren't needed any more

Should we use -flto? https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html

-- In Scalar, some are modified in place and some are not
-- Have some way of being consistent about this 

-- In cVector.c and scalar.c, when we have an error condition
-- are we popping things off the stack as we should be?


Use shell script to run test_save/test_restore 

save meta_data in Q.save() e.g., sort_order

Saving when is_lma == true, what do we do with chunk mem?

Why is there no matching decr_ref_count for incr_ref_count

Delete following from lVector.lua. 
Not good to have info on both C and Lua side. 
Keep it in C even if there is a cost of crossing C API to fetch it 

Make the C implementation of print_csv the default

Confirm that updates and gets do not cause movements in hashmap


Why does dlclose() not work some times? I have commented it out 
in TMPL_FIX_HASHMAP

The build system has a special target for an amalgamated build, i.e. make amalg. This compiles the LuaJIT core as one huge C file and allows GCC to generate faster and shorter code. Alas, this requires lots of memory during the build. This may be a problem for some users, that's why it's not enabled by default. But it shouldn't be a problem for most build farms. It's recommended that binary distributions use this target for their LuaJIT builds.

The tl;dr version of the above:

make amalg PREFIX=/usr && \
make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/buildroot
===================================================
Memory manager (prefetch calls) should run in separate thread

Should we initialize memory to 0?

Bring ISPC back to life
Bring OpenMP back to life
Do some code reviews of save() and import() 
In import, document that order of import is important. Understand why 

Experiment with prefetch

Write some tests on memory usage with kill

where do we keep max_num_in_chunk? Lua or C. Be consistent
What of init_globals() needs to be saved in Q.save() 
  and restored after that
What happens if you restore but do not save. Do files get deleted?
Or does the persist persist (hah!)
