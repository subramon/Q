Download ispc binary
e.g.,I have downloaded it in ~/ISPC/
Set the path in the .bashrc file as shown below
# For ISPC
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/ISPC/ispc-v1.13.0-linux/bin


I have a hack in UTILS/build/Makefile to 
cp ~/luaffi/ffi.so into $Q_ROOT/lib/

#-----------------
# export PATH=<path_to_where_llvm_is unpacked>/bin-10.0/bin:$PATH
export PATH="$HOME/bin-10.0/bin:$PATH
