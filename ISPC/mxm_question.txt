I was reading the matrix multiple example in 

https://indico.cern.ch/event/267608/contributions/1604226/attachments/478423/661899/ispc.pdf

and I was puzzled why the code did not generate any warnings. I would have thought that the inner loop would cause a scalar load not a vector load.
        sum += A[i*K*nmat + k*nmat + idx] * B[k*N*nmat + j*nmat + idx];
I have attached the code for ease of reading


inline void mxm(
    uniform float * uniform A,
    uniform float * uniform B,
    uniform float * uniform C,
    uniform int M,
    uniform int N,
    uniform int K,
    uniform int nmat,
    int idx
    )
{
  for(uniform int i = 0; i < M; i++){
    for(uniform int j = 0; j < N; j++){
      float sum = 0;

      for(uniform int k = 0; k < K; k++){
        sum += A[i*K*nmat + k*nmat + idx] * B[k*N*nmat + j*nmat + idx];
      }

      C[i*N*nmat + j*nmat + idx] = sum;
    }
  }
}
export void gemm(
    uniform float * uniform A,
    uniform float * uniform B,
    uniform float * uniform C,
    uniform int M,
    uniform int N,
    uniform int K,
    uniform int nmat
    )
{
  foreach(i = 0 ... nmat) {
    mxm(A, B, C, M, N, K, nmat, i);
  }
}
