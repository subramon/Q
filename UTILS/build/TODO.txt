Go through all places where q_incs is used and strip it down to the basics
custom for each piece of code

Document the following

1) All structs need to be mentioned in add_h_files_to_list.lua as in
local struct_files = {
  "core_vec_struct.h",
  "scalar_struct.h",
  "spooky_struct.h",
  "cmem_struct.h",

2) If you have a constant you are using in a struct, make sure to define
it in q_constants.h

3) Make sure you do not have multi-line definitions in q_constants.h
