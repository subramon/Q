-- The first thing we do is to make sure that we can access functionality
-- provided by C from Lua. This assumes that 2 files have been created
-- incfile, typically $HOME/local/Q/include/q_core.h
-- sofile,  typically $HOME/local/Q/lib/libq_core.so
-- The incfile contains
-- 1) all typedef statements
-- 2) all function prototypes
-- The incfile is created by concatenating all the .h files for Q
-- with the condition that the typedef struct statements should precede
-- their usage
-- The sofile is the .so file created by aggregating the .o files 
-- which are in turn created by compiling all the .c files for Q
--
-- Dynamic versus static compilation
-- In the case of dynamic compilation, the incfile and sofile referenced 
-- above will be quite small and will contain the bare essentials
-- In the case of static compilation, they are likely to be quite large
--
-- Regardless, they need to exist before we can continue
