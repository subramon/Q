Question = how to maximize the percent of profitable transactions (y = 1), with subset n having a minimum 500 samples?

Variables are all float, x1, x2, ... x14. Predicted variable is y

Best single query: 
x14 > 488. 
This results in 500 samples where 265/500, or 53%, are profitable (y = 1)

The best compound query is:
(x14 > 362) and (x13 < 1,090,000,000)
This results in 507 samples where 274/500, or 54%, are profitable.
