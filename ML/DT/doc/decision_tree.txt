Calculate odds, based on npos/nneg in entire data set
1) For numeric attributes or ordered categorical
sort X. 
start with brk = -infty, npos = nneg = 0
keep moving brk upwards, updating npos, nneg as you go.
For each new brk, calculate payout

2) For boolean attributes
break into true and false and 

3) For categorical cattributes
select all n choose 2 combinations and compute npos, nneg


=====================================
Now divide data set using brk with highest payout
Go back to top for each of 2 data sets created.
Don't investigate a data set with too few entries
