In the process of finding out best estimator (best DT classifier) in sklearn with given train and test data, we are using GridSearchCV with below param_grid

"max_depth" : [ 1 to 20 ],
"min_samples_split" : [ 5 to 20 ],
"min_samples_leaf" : [ 1 to 5 ],
"criterion" : ['gini','entropy']

And the scoring method that we are considering are -
1. accuracy
2. f1
3. f1_weighted

So in this way, for each scoring method we are getting the best estimator, which we are loading in Q and finding the metric score (eg. credit-debit score etc).
