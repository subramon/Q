TO BE COMPLETED

Parameters to be supported by testing code

1) Number of iterations, usually 20
2) Split between training and testing, usually 80/20

3) Alpha: table of scalars used to scale the distance contribution from each
attribute

4) Exponent: usually we will do (xi-yi)^2 but it should be possible 
to vary the 2 to something else; in which case we will need to take absolute
value as well.
