/* README: 

determine_rho_loc(hash_val,m,ptr_rho,ptr_loc): This function calculates the rho and loc value for a given hash value and number of bins. rho is the location of the least significant 1 in the binary representation of hash_val. loc is the bin id to which the input element is assigned. 

INPUTS:

hash_val: 64-bit integer produced by some hash function.

m: Number of bins used by the algorithm.

OUTPUTS: 

ptr_rho: Location where the rho value is stored. ex: if hash_val = 0b1001111000100 then rho = 3, if hash_val = 0b010101111 then rho = 1.

ptr_loc: Location where the loc value is stored. If m bins are used, this value is going to be in between 0 and m-1.

status = approx_unique(x,ptr_estimate,ptr_accuracy,ptr_estimate_is_good): Calculates the cardinality (number of unique elements) of an integer set approximately using very little memory. The percentage accuracy in estimation (the approximation basically) will be stored in ptr_accuracy. 

The approximation percentages observed during extensive testing are roughly as follows:
(i) Data sets with cardinality  > 200,000 will be estimated within 1% accuracy
(ii) Data sets with cardinality > 100,000 will be estimated with 2-3% accuracy
(iii) Data sets with cardinality > 10,000 will be estimated with 6% accuracy
(iv) Data sets with cardinality > 1,000 will be estimated with 30% accuracy
(v) Data sets with cardinality < 1,000: the algorithm will quit setting ptr_accuracy to 100 and ptr_estimate_is_good will have a value -2.

Algorithm: Hyperloglog by Philippe Flajolet 

INPUTS: 

x: array containing the input data to be processed.

nX: Number of elements in the input array x. 

OUTPUTS: 

ptr_y: Pointer to the location where the calculated cardinality of x will be stored.

ptr_accuracy: Pointer to the location where the percentage error in the calculated cardinality of x will be stored. ex: 1.22 => +/-1.22% (3 sigma rule used)

ptr_estimate_is_good: Pointer to a location where 1,-1,-2 or -3  will be stored. Use this as a sanity check: 1 is good, everything else is bad.
(1) 1: Hyperloglog algorithm successfully calculated cardinality. Outputs *y, *ptr_estimate_accuracy are reliable/ accurate with very high probability (99%). 
(2) -1: Hyperloglog algorithm failed to calculate the cardinality due to error in inputs (some of them NULL maybe). *y will be set to -1 and *ptr_accuracy will be set to 100%. 
(3) -2: Hyperloglog algorithm failed to calculate cardinality as input cardinality too small for Hyperloglog to work. I would suggest using (key, value) storage based sorting using binary search trees (example: std::maps in C++, levelDB etc) due to low cardinality. *y will be set to -1 and *ptr_accuracy will be set to 100%
(4) -3: Hyperloglog algorithm failed to calculate cardinality due to one of the two cases: (a) The odd chance that the hash function produced a value which is divisible by 2^44. This will happen very very very rarely unless you are dealing with datasets with more than 100 billion unique elements, just retrying the code would help solve the issue. (b) The dataset indeed has more than 100 billion unique elements. In that case, you need to use a 128 bit hash function (like "spooky_hash128"). Edit this code and determine_rho_loc code accordingly. Make sure you back up this code before editing. *y will be set to -1 and *ptr_accuracy will be set to 100%.

status: Takes values 0 or -1. 
0: The algorithm either computed the cardinality and set  *ptr_estimate_is_good to 1 (and ptr_accuracy to whatever % the accuracy is) or the computations were not possible and set *ptr_estimate_is_good to -2 (low cardinality) or -3 (extremely high cardinality or hash function gave bad outputs). 
-1: Something wrong with the inputs, *ptr_estimate_is_good will be set to -1.

  /* m is the number of bins used by hyperloglog. Calculations in this work assume m to be power of 2 and 128 <= m <= 2^20 for convenience. Unless you know what you are doing and it's impact on other lines of this code (incl. determine_rho_loc function), PLEASE DONOT VIOLATE THIS CONDITION.*/

  /* NOTE: Higher m guarantees lesser error (less than {3 * 1.04/sqrt(m)} % with 99% probability). This would mean that m = Inf would give us 0 error. The catch is that hyperloglog algorithm assumes that all bins are used by atleast some input elements (to ensure stochastic averaging). Typical thumb rule for  m: the cardinality of the data set has to be atleast around 3-5 times m (ideally m log(m) so that all the bins are used sufficiently). This can't be checked beforehand as we don't know the cardinality (that's what we are trying to estimate here). The strategy we'll be using to overcome this: Start with a high m (65536 works well: +/- 1.22%). If some bins are unused, keep reducing m by a factor of 2 by combining neigbhoring bins (to maintain independence) till all the bins are used sufficiently. */
