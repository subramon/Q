here are the steps involved when executing a Q statement

q("some string representing command")
where q is a lua function. What does it do?

1) Use pcall to hand off to parser, which returns a JSON or nil
2) Call opname.lua, depending on operator in JSON.
3) Create files (for fields)/directories (for tables) corresponding to operator.
Mark these as "work in progress"
4) Use pcall to call C function corresponding to opname, returning table for
scalars or true for status=0 or nil/error message
5) If necessary, delete WIP fields/directories
6) Return control. 


Independent of above, we could read/write meta-data file at start/end
