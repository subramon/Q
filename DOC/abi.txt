The Oracle Solaris ABI is also the C ABI, because C is the standard UNIX implementation language. Among other things, the C ABI specifies:

Size and layout of predefined types (char, int, float, and so on)
Layout of compound types (arrays and structs)
External (linker-visible) spelling of programmer-defined names
Machine-code function-calling sequence
Stack layout
Register usage
