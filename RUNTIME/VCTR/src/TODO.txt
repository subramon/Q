Table spaces need to be thought through properly

Quit early if is_err == true

Save and restore need to be thought through properly
  Re-understand ref_count and write defensive code

What about is_lma and memo_len. See comment in early_free()
I think is_lna == true => is_eov == true. As a consequence, memo/free/kill are
irrelevant.

Implement nn_vctr_id on both Lua and C 

In cVector.c
has_nn_vec
get_nn_vec
set_nn_vec
is_nn_vec


IMPORTANT In lVector.lua
Delete everything with self._ except for
self._base_vec
self._is_dead
self._meta
