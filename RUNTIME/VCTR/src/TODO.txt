Make it Okay for a vector to have 0 elements

Categorize and deal with meta data of Vector properly.

Special ones start with double underscore and are
__has_nulls
__name
__min
__max
__sum
__meaning



When vector is created with rehydrate, then you need to rename
files to be consistent with uqid and Q_DATA_DIR format

Does one always need to do the above? Think about it a bit

Fix clean_defs and delete local version of clean_defs

Deal with chunk_dir expansion and contraction
Deal with chunk_dir_idxs expansion and contraction
