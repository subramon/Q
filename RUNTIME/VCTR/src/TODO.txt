Make it Okay for a vector to have 0 elements

Categorize and deal with meta data of Vector properly.

Special ones start with double underscore and are
__has_nulls
__name
__min
__max
__sum
__meaning


Deal with chunk_dir expansion and contraction
Deal with chunk_dir_idxs expansion and contraction

put_chunk has to deal with no_memcpy

Currently, last chunk is saved in full even if only partially occupied. 
Reduce extra file writes

Currently, we do not write vector name on shutdown. 
Hence, it is lost on reincarnation.
Okay because this is just a debugging feature.
But would be nice to fix it some time.
