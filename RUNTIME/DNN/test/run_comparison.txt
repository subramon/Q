To produce the input files using dnn.py, refer Q/RUNTIME/DNN/python/README.txt

Produced files are as below

5 lua files (in "Q/RUNTIME/DNN/python/" directory)
    _Xin.lua
    _Xout.lua
    _npl.lua
    _dpl.lua
    _afns.lua

 and the following 4 C files (in "Q/RUNTIME/DNN/python/" directory)
    _set_W.c
    _set_B.c
    _set_Z.c
    _set_A.c
    _set_Wprime.c -- W at the end of back prop
    _set_Bprime.c -- b at the end of back prop

These files are required before running the comparison test

==================================

Run python Vs C comparison_test.lua

> copy the generated files from pytyon directory to test directory
    $ cp Q/RUNTIME/DNN/python/_* Q/RUNTIME/DNN/test/

> Build the DNN
    $ cd Q/RUNTIME/DNN/src/ 
    $ make clean
    $ make with CFLAGS set as following
      CFLAGS = $(QC_FLAGS) -DTEST_VS_PYTHON 

> run test t1 in comparison_test.lua
    $ luajit -e "require 'comparison_test'['t1']()" 

A few things to note:
Keep the number of instances small.
The batch size must be set to the number of instances
