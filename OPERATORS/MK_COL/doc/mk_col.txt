Sometimes, we need to create a column on the fly, without having to
load it from a file.  This is usually the case when one has a small
number of values that one wants to create a column out of.

For example, x = mk_col({10, 20, 30, 40}, "I4") should return a column
consisting of 4 rows, where each cell is a 4-byte integer and the
values are as follows:

x[0] = 10
x[1] = 20
x[2] = 30
x[3] = 40

This should be a simple modification of the functionality in load_csv

Couple of notes. We will support only the following types

I1
I2
I4
I8
F4
F8

A column so created, by definition, has no null values.

SC -- can be pushed till later if time is short. In this case, the
user does not specify the width, the program will set the width as the
max width+1. For example, if we load x = mk_col({"a", "bc", "def"}, "SC"), 
then the width will be 4.
