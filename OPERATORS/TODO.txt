static verus dynamic scheduling for OpenMP

all specializers should return
1) fn == name of function
2) proto = function prototype
3) anything else needed e.g, output type for f1f2opf3 and so on



I will write a new function called

Q.eq(x, y, epsilon), which takes 2 vectors x, y and a Scalar epsilon and returns true if abs(x[I]-y[I]) < epsilon for all I
