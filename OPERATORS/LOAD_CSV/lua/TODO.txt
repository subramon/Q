Test the newer varioants like TM_to_SC etc 

Currently load does not handle "" in a string.
What this means is that if a field is of the form
"abc""def"
then the actual value of the string is 
abc"def

We handle this properly in the following case
"abc\"def" 
here the actual value of the string is 
abc"def
============================

It is possible that now, an invalid CSV file , can be parsed successfully.  For example, if the CSV file contains all the I1 fields and in the format below 1, 2, 3

                    1, 2

                    1, 2

                    1, 2

After running the load script , 3 binary files will be created of type I1 as 
1st Binary file   2nd Binary file    3rd Binary file

    1                          2                                3 
    1                          2                                1
    2                          1                                2


============================
Should be able to handle base other than 10.
