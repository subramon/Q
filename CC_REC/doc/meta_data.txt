The fields (in orders) are 
'updated_at', 'user_id', 'credit_score', 'on_time_payments’, 'credit_util_percentage', 'quarterly', ‘two_years’, 'credit_card_id', 'txn_ct', 'src_unique_click_id'

I have used blue to mark the ones used (others can be filtered out). 
credit_score is a number between 300 and 850
on_time_payments is a fraction between 0 and 1
credit_utilization percentage is a fraction >= 0
quarterly is a number >= 0
two_years is a number >= 0
credit_card_id is a number
txn_ct == 0 means rejected else approved
