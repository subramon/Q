IDE for development (especially debugging):  
https://studio.zerobrane.com/

Even if you prefer the shell for coding and despise IDEs, in case of Lua the ZeroBrane studio seems to have the best debugger. And this IDE does minimal “magic” - so you can code and run from the shell, but use IDE just for debugging.

Installation: Simply download the Linux installer shell script from “Downloads” and execute it.

Interpreter
The ZeroBrane studio defaults to using LuaJIT 2.0.2 as the interpreter.
The interpreter can be changed from Project->Lua Interpreter
Note: Lua 5.1 isn’t shipped by default

Gotchas:

- Debugger steps into lua functions in another file only if the other file is open; otherwise it steps over. See faq question “Why stepping into function calls doesn’t work in some cases?”
- With LuaJIT, occasionally it steps on same line multiple times; see https://studio.zerobrane.com/doc-luajit-debugging
- If you require any other files, set package.path at start of script accordingly
package.path = package.path .. ';/home/foo/bar/Q/experimental/SUM/?.lua'
     Setting package.path is least magic so I prefer this approach for now.
  CORRECTION: This is different from command line semantic; to be checked.
  
Practical points:
I set the project directory to the top-level folder (e.g. Q) – that gives me access to all files.
For a “project” setup, we should have an explicit “point of entry” lua file (e.g. main.lua), that sets paths, loads libraries etc. as needed

TODOs:
Debugging (stepping) into C functions invoked from Lua programs
Lua 5.1 interpreter

Environment specific notes: 
While we test and support Ubuntu (14.04), this section captures any observations reported on other environments.

On mac os x when I compiled and attached my dynamic libs I got an error stating "mach-o, but wrong architecture”.  We need to compile the libs with a -m32 flag.

Alternate IDEs

Pluses:
It’s eclipse :)
Multiple “projects” view etc
Minuses:
Debugger configuration has extra dependencies and was too time-consuming to get going
Does some “magic” w.r.t. paths, so command-line compatibility would require additional overseeing
