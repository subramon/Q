Subject: [terralang] Support for 64 bit on osx
To: "terralang@lists.stanford.edu" <terralang@lists.stanford.edu>


Hello
It appears that luajit can now support being loaded as a library without recompiling the main application.

Can the Terra binary downloads released on the website be compiled with this feature turned on? Would it affect other operating systems?
Or would I need to build Terra myself?

Kind regards
Saptarshi



LuaJIT for x64 can optionally be built for LJ_GC64 mode by enabling the -DLUAJIT_ENABLE_GC64 line in src/Makefile or via 'msvcbuild.bat gc64'." "This mode removes the 32 bit limitation for garbage collected memory on 64 bit systems.
