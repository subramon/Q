Ramesh mentioned you’re coming up with a coding style doc; it’s especially important as this is an open-source project.
I usually tend to split style guidelines into two categories: mandated and recommended.
 
“Mandated” examples:
-          Indentation (spaces or tabs, indent level)
-          Snake_case
-          Naming convention for files (should it begin with capital letter or small?); snake_case or camelCase for file names?
-          Relative location of test cases to source code (we’re yet to finalize this I think)
 
“Recommended” examples:
-          Avoid parentheses when not needed (e.g. single parameter function call, if-statement) – suggested by Indrajeet
-          Put the code-block for conditionals/loops on the next line (indented) even if the code block is single statement. This is something I feel quite strongly about w.r.t. readability (and  seems it’s not currently followed in certain places especially validations)
o   For example, this is bad
if cond1 and cond2 and cond3 then a = a + 1 end
o   This is good
if cond1 and cond2 and cond3 then 
                a = a + 1
end
-          Descriptive names for variables, especially ones with long scope
o   Exception for iteration variables e.g. i,j,k  for counters
 
The above is all for Lua code; we’ll need similar for C code (e.g. for operator-template-writing we’ll have separate style-guide).
 
Does that make sense?
We’ll all continue to identify and add more to your doc as we go along… thanks for getting this started.
 
Srinath.

Not much new or too authoritative here, but any reference can help as referee when many (all) team-members are new to a language and have backgrounds/baggage of coding style potentially conflicting in certain minor details

Oldie but Goldie :-)

Old message but worth reading again for all new team members. Please read carefully, especially link at end of mail

Only one thing I would like to change. Unlike Indrajeet, I like explicit parentheses. So, I would rather write

( ( a == b ) and ( x > 0 ) )

Rather than 

 A == b and x > 0
