Dynamic compilation enables you to start with a lightwieght Q binary and add
functions as and when we need them. 

To use dynamic compilation we need to provide the dotc and doth files to q_core.
Q_cire has a function qcadd, that function enables you to compile a new dynamic
linked library. The way to know that a function is not present in q_core is
simply by the fact that q_core will return nil (saying that the function is not
found). To add a new function we need to provide a dotc amd dpth to q_core.
Q-core wikk then compile and register the new function. After the function is
registered q_core will return the newly registered function. Next time when Q is
restarted all the .sos with valids .h files is regisred and available without
anything additional.

Note that for dynamic compilation sometimes you made need more functions apart
from the function being dynamically compiled (for example setting bits). Such
functions must be present in q_core as q_core is linked to every dynamically
generated library.
