There are 4 kinds of installations that I would like to see.

(1) Assume that latest Ubuntu minimal server install is in place

In this case, 

a) I will start with a git clone of the Q repo

b) After that, I want a single script that will install and configure
*everything* that I need for Lua. 

This script is free to use LuaRocks or install from source. In case of
LuaRocks, I would like to be able to specify which version of the
package I am interested in. If not, then I would prefer that we
install from source that we have checked into our repo.

This script should also modify the .bashrc file so that the
environment is exaclty the way we want it. Note that it may also have
to modify the .vimrc file or other such files so that we write code in
the same way (e.g., tabs or spaces?)

Indrajeet to do (later): Figure out if and how Vagrant fits in?

--- Setting up machine
Use minimal install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 
When asked about packages to install, select 
standard system utilities
openssh server
See screenshot
sudo apt-get install texlive-full git  build-essential indent libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev




### Building Lua 5.1.3
wget https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.3.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lua-5.1.3.tar.gz
cd lua-5.1.3
make linux && sudo make install

### Building luajit
wget http://luajit.org/download/LuaJIT-2.0.4.tar.gz
tar -xvzf LuaJIT-2.0.4.tar.gz
cd LuaJIT-2.0.4/
make && sudo make install

### Luarocks
wget http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases/luarocks-2.4.2.tar.gz
tar -xvzf luarocks-2.4.2.tar.gz
cd luarocks-2.4.2/
./configure && make build && sudo make install


### Someone needs to test luaffi compilation with lua5.1 alone


### Setup Env ###
git clone
cd Q
export LUA_INIT="@`pwd`/init.lua"
`lua |tail -1`
export Q_SRC_ROOT=`pwd`
cd UTILS/build
luajit build.lua gen.lua

-------------------------------------------------------------

(2) In case I want to run on any other platform, there will be
instructions but there is no expectation of support for these
instructions.

----------------------------------

(3) An ISO that I can boot a machine (physical or virtual) from and
which installs everything from the OS on up. To confirm, this should
be able to install withot Internet access. Ideally, it will create a few
standard users and groups as well. 

(4) Same as above but for Raspberry Pi as opposed to x86 

(5) Create image for deploy as uni-kernel
