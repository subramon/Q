1) chunk size will always be a multiple of 64. 

2) If you have a bit vector with 66 entries. It will be written as 128
bits = 16 bytes NOT as 8+1 = 9 bytes

3) Above is true for other types as well. So, if you have an integer
column with 65 elements. It will be stored in a file of length
128*sizeof(int) = 512 bytes
