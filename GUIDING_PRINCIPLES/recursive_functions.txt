The way myvec is used is similar to this example n

A subtle point arises in the definition of recursive local functions. The naive approach does not work here:

    local fact = function (n)
      if n == 0 then return 1
      else return n*fact(n-1)   -- buggy
      end
    end
When Lua compiles the call fact(n-1), in the function body, the local fact is not yet defined. Therefore, that expression calls a global fact, not the local one. To solve that problem, we must first define the local variable and then define the function:
    local fact
    fact = function (n)
      if n == 0 then return 1
      else return n*fact(n-1)
      end
    end
