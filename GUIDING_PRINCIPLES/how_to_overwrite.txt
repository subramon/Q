As an example

package.loaded['Q/UTILS/lua/q_consts'].debug = true

so you can over-write your local version without modifying the 
original file

As an example, see how to change chunk size. This is more complicated because
the Vector library accesses chunk size and sets it internally well before we
would know the chunk size we want 

  -- set chunk size to encompass data set (okay for small data sets)
  local chunk_size = 1024
  while chunk_size < nI do
    chunk_size = chunk_size * 2
  end
  print("chunk_size set to ", chunk_size)
  package.loaded['Q/UTILS/lua/q_consts'].chunk_size = chunk_size
  Vector.set_chunk_size(chunk_size);
