Interesting why this failed. Very subtle bug. Basically, the code that got generated was

x = (x, y)

Instead of x = min(x, y

Because of an error in the substitutions.  The code is legal!!!

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  int x = 10, y = 20;
  int z = (x, y);
  printf("z = %d \n", z);
}

C is so cutely bewildering at times :)

Particularly the "uses" section is fascinating... Amazing ... the tricks used to accomplish a lot of things (e.g. assert) we take for granted in newer languages.

Thanks a lot for pointing out this"bug",
